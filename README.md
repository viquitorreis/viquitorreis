### What I actually do

I build backend systems with Go. Spent the last few years making NIR spectroscopy data work at scale, handling real-time processing for agricultural analysis. Moved entire platforms between clouds without breaking shit. Built sync systems for offline mobile devices that needed to eventually be consistent.

### Current interests

Distributed systems and network programming. The kind of problems where eventual consistency isn't just a buzzword, it's Tuesday.

Working on understanding how things actually work - from TCP handshakes to consensus algorithms. Reading papers, implementing toy versions, breaking things to see why they break.
