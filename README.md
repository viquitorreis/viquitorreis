### What I actually do

I build backend systems with Go. Spent the last few years making NIR spectroscopy data work at scale, handling real-time processing for agricultural analysis. Moved entire platforms between clouds without breaking shit. Built sync systems for offline mobile devices that needed to eventually be consistent.
