## Victor Reis

Backend engineer from Brazil. Built systems that process 100k+ requests daily for agritech. Used to fix heavy machinery, now I fix distributed systems.

Currently looking for remote work with companies that actually ship things. Open to US/EU/Australia.

### What I actually do

I build backend systems with Go. Spent the last few years making NIR spectroscopy data work at scale, handling real-time processing for agricultural analysis. Moved entire platforms between clouds without breaking shit. Built sync systems for offline mobile devices that needed to eventually be consistent.

**Tech I use when it makes sense:**
- Go for everything that needs to be fast and reliable
- PostgreSQL because I trust it
- gRPC when REST feels wasteful
- Docker/K8s for deployment
- AWS/OCI depending on who's paying

### Current interests

Distributed systems and network programming. The kind of problems where eventual consistency isn't just a buzzword, it's Tuesday.

Working on understanding how things actually work - from TCP handshakes to consensus algorithms. Reading papers, implementing toy versions, breaking things to see why they break.

Also finishing a multi-seller marketplace with Stripe Connect. Because understanding payment systems is useful.

### Not programming

Boxing 6x/week. Helps me think clearly about hard problems. Or maybe just gives me an excuse to punch things when code doesn't work.
